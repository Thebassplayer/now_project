# Now Proyect ðŸ—º

Now Project is a Web app that gives you information about your location in real time, allowing you to save it, add photograps and request information from previous locations.

Now make requests to 2 different web APIs. Leaflet api to render the map and openweathermap api to get weather info. Also uses browser location api to get your geolocation.

In this proyect I implemented Express.js to create a web server and NeDB to save your previous location on a database.
